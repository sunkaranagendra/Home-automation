# Home-automation
You must have seen automatic door openers in shopping malls and other commercial buildings. They open the door when someone comes near the entrance and close it after sometime. A number of technologies are available to make such kinds of systems like PIR sensors, Radar sensors,  Laser sensors, Infrared sensors, etc. In this arduino based project, we have tried to replicate the same system by using a PIR sensor. 
It uses a motion-detecting sensor (PIR sensor) to open or close the door which detects the infrared energy omitted from human's body. When someone comes in front of the door, the infrared energy detected by the sensor changes and it triggers the sensor to open the door whenever someone approaches the door. The signal is further sent to arduino uno that controls the door.
